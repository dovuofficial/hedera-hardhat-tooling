/**
 * This contract of the most basic approach to:
 *   1) Projects being able to be created to be staked against
 *   2) Uses been able to claim demo tokens to stack towards a project
 *   3) Uses being able to withdraw tokens from the project and then deposit them into another.
 *
 * Question? Should we used ReentrancyGuard for anything that calls HTS?
